Leaving the shelter of our vessel behind for the hope of a new home. Many withered away under the scorching heat of the twin suns and the constant attacks from **Ravagers**, but Mother Earth kept her promise.*\n\n*In our darkest hour, we laid eyes on **The Sanctum**, a city of the gods.

This place was truly a divine gift.*\n\n*At the highest point of the city in the tower that touched the clouds, we found **The Librarian**. A meticulous mechanical record keeper hovering over his book, the great **Codex Arcana**. This was a book written in detail to record the actions of every man, woman, and child that lived among us. But it was far too powerful, and the secrets it contained proved lethal in the wrong hands.*\n\n*And so began the **factions**, vying for control over the Codex.*\n\n- Excerpt from the **Teachings of Tiberius**.
